###### by [Leomar Dur√°n][lduran2]

## Introduction

This program finds the cross product of $2$ given $3$-dimensional vectors.
The program will find a vector of triple products
produced by the dot product of normalized vectors and these two vectors
given a matrix with each row representing a dot multiplier vector
prior to normalization.

### Motivation

The use of this program is for applications such as
* finding the moment of a force-vector formulation in engineering statics, or
* finding the .

Cross product for graphing calulcators including the TI-84 Plus SE.
